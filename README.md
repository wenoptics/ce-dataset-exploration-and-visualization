# Exploring the CE Dataset

## Step 1: Data Exploration

Checkout [ce_data_explore.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/wenoptics/ce-dataset-exploration-and-visualization/blob/7877720933ad65e3b38c122b7d960d501b1eca10/ce_data_explore.ipynb).

My objective of this visualization is to provide an intuitive perception of 
how the some aspects of employment (maybe more interested in Information Technology 
related fields) have been changing over time. The dataset that I will depend 
on will (primary) be National Employment, Hours, and Earnings (link to Kaggle) 
provided by Current Employment Statistics (CES).

For the purpose of the visualization, I would have to explore around the data, 
understand the dataset. This notebook exposes these steps...

## Step 2:

A visualization of _1998-2018 Employment Growth Rate in the United States in 6 Industries_ 

![](doc/preview_0.png)


> The 6 selected industries ( _i.e. 'Goods-producing',
 'Gasoline stations',
 'Portfolio management',
 'Computer systems design and related services',
 'Education and health services',
 'Bowling centers'_ ) 
 shows diversed pattern in employment growth rate over the years, where the X-axis are the year from 1999 to 2018 
 (1999 means the the period of 1998-1999), and the Y-axis are the growth rate to the previous year in percentage.
 The data is collected monthly, on non-supervisory employeers (production workers).
>  
> Worth mentioned that the year 2000 and the year 2008 cause signanificance negative employment rate on most industries, which, by I assumption, has great correlation to the 
[2000 Dot-com Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) 
and the [Financial crisis of 2007â€“2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008). 
During such periods, only the _Education and health services_ remain positive growth, and many other industries
in varies in different supersectors drops their employment.
> 
> And it can also be observed that the _Computer systems design and related services_ and 
_Education and health services_ has better resistance against the 2018 Financial crisis.
